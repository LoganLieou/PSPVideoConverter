## PSP Video Converter

Simple little script which converts videos to the PSP compatible video format using ffmpeg commandline tool.

## Prerequisites

You need to install ffmpeg i.e. `brew install ffmpeg` or whatnot

## Usage

`./convert input_name.mp4 output_name.mp4` 

do note: that this has only been tested so far on a PSP 1000 system, with mp4
videos so I cannot say weather this script will work for you if you are using
say avi or mkv videos although I'm pretty certian this works for all PSP
systems.
